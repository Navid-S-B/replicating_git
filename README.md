# Replicating Git Using Bash
This was a school project focusing on the fundamentals and understanding how git works overall. Based on the specifications, we had to implement simple git functions such as init, add, commit, log, rm and so on!

I used a hidden folder to hold the saved code, but I also added rules and conditions where files are not
uneccessarily overwritten nor accidently deleted.

This project will be continued to be improved on, to improve my shell scripting skills!

Refer to the spec for further detail.
